    <h1> Verse 1 </h1>
    <p>What would you do with a drunken sailor,</p>
    <p>What would you do with a drunken sailor,</p>
    <p>What would you do with a drunken sailor early in the morning.</p>
    <h2> Verse 2 </h2>
    <p>Put 'em in the brig until he's sober, </p>
    <p>Put 'em in the bring until he's sober, </p>
    <p>Put 'em  in the brig until he sobber early in the morning! </p>
    <h2> Verse n </h2>
    <p> These lyrics don't make sense </p>

    <h2> Lists </h2>

    <p> This is how you make an unordered list: </p>

    <ul>
      <li> Add a "ul" element (it stands for unordereed list)</li>
      <li> Add each item in its own "li" element </li>
      <li> They don't need to be in any particular order </li>
    </ul>

    <p>This is what an ordered list looks like: </p>

    <ol>
      <li>Notice the new "ol" element wrapping everything</li>
      <li>But, the list item elements are the same </li>
      <li>Also note how the numbers incrememnt on their own </li>
      <li>You should be noticing things is this precise order, because
        this is an ordered list </li>
    </ol>

    <h2>Inline Elements</h2>

    <p><em>Sometimes</em>, you need to draw attention to a particular word or
      prhase.</p>

    <p>Other times you need to <strong>strong</strong> emphasize the importance
      of a word or phrase.</p>

    <p><em><strong>And somestimes you need to shout!</strong></em></p>


    <h2>Empty Elements</h2>

    <p>Instead, use a br/ statement!</p>

    <p>P.S. This page might look like a child made it (you are one), but we'll
      fix that soon with some CSS!</p>

    <p>What does an empty paragraph look like?</p>
    <p></p>
    <p>Is these space between the statement above and this one? If so,
      it works!</p>
    <p> This method of doing an empty p /p does not work!</p>
