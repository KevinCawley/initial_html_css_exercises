<!-- Rules for the grid-template-are are:
  You need to have every cell of the grid filled.
  To span across two cells, repeat the name.
  To leave a cell empty, use a . (period).
  Areas must be rectangular, you cannot have an L-shaped for ex.
  Area's can't be repeated in different locations.
